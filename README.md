# Websites

Here there are 2 versions of my sites:
1. using React, Node.js. controlling the MySQL db using sequelize
2. using HTML, CSS, JS. controlling the MySQL db using CRUD class

Both are SPA, communticating with my other project which is located in the 'Projects' repository named "gateway_server" (via HTTP)
their purpose is to let companies register them self and their products, using a Java Servlet/ Node Server and logging all in a MySQL db.
